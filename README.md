#Brainster Challenge 06

Challenge 06 - GitLab Challenge

#Overview
Welcome to Challenge 06! This GitLab challenge is an opportunity for users to showcase their skills and knowledge of Git and version control. In this README file, I will provide an in-depth overview of the steps I have taken to complete this challenge, as well as my previous challenges.

#Steps Taken
To start off, I created a new project on GitLab. I then cloned this project onto my local machine using the git clone command. This allowed me to work on the project locally and push changes to GitLab as needed.

#Branching
Next, I created a new branch for each of my previous challenges, starting from the main branch. This allowed me to keep my work for each challenge separate and easily accessible. For example, I created a new branch called Challenge01, and added my challenge code into that branch. To push this branch live on GitLab, I used the following commands: git add Challenge01, followed by git commit -m "Initial Commit" and git push.

I repeated this process for all my previous challenges, creating new branches for each challenge, and pushing them live on GitLab. This helped me keep my work organized and made it easy to access and review my progress.

#GitIgnore

When I got to Challenge06, I decided to install a gitignore for my README.MD file. This was because I had created a new README.txt file for this description, and I did not want to accidentally push my README.MD file to GitLab. The gitignore file ensured that this would not happen.

#Git Terminal

Throughout the challenge, I used Git Terminal to manage my repository and make changes to my code. Git Terminal is a powerful tool that provides users with a command-line interface for Git. This allowed me to perform various Git operations such as cloning, branching, committing, and pushing with ease.

#Conclusion

In conclusion, this README file provides a detailed overview of the steps I have taken to complete Challenge 06 using Git Terminal. By creating new branches for each challenge and installing a gitignore, I was able to keep my work organized and efficient. Git Terminal was a powerful tool that allowed me to manage my repository and make changes to my code with ease. I hope this description provides valuable insights to others who are taking on similar challenges on GitLab.

GitLab Project Setup:

- Log in to your GitLab account and create a new project. Give it a name and description.
- Copy the URL of the project.
- Local Repository Setup:

- Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store your local repository.
- Clone the GitLab project to your local machine using the command: git clone [project URL].
- Change to the project directory using the command: cd [project directory].
- Creating and Switching to a New Branch:

- Create a new branch using the command: git branch [new branch name].
- Switch to the new branch using the command: git checkout [new branch name].

Making and Committing Changes:

- Make changes to your files as needed. Once you've made changes, stage them using the command: git add [file name].
- Commit your changes using the command: git commit -m "your commit message here".

Pushing Changes to GitLab:

Once you've committed your changes, push them to GitLab using the command: git push origin [new branch name].

Merging Changes:

- After pushing changes to GitLab, you can create a merge request to merge your changes into the main branch.
- Once a merge request is approved, you can fetch the latest changes from the main branch using the command: git fetch.
- Then, switch to the main branch using the command: git checkout main.
- Pull the latest changes from the main branch using the command: git pull.
- Finally, merge your changes into the main branch using the command: git merge [new branch name].

And that's it! You've successfully made changes to a GitLab project, pushed them to GitLab, and merged them into the main branch.
